Improved PyTorch implementation of https://github.com/mightydeveloper/Deep-Compression-PyTorch for'Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding'  by Song Han, Huizi Mao, William J. Dally

Most of the code heavily borrowed from https://github.com/mightydeveloper/Deep-Compression-PyTorch

The configurations and running steps are referred to https://github.com/mightydeveloper/Deep-Compression-PyTorch

This code extended the unstructured conv transformation, which can conducted compression for linear and convolution layers. More construction such as Resnet and Darknet can be compressed by this code.
